Navigating U.S. tax requirements as a non-resident or international individual can be overwhelming—especially when you don’t qualify for a Social Security Number. That’s where the ITIN comes in. An ITIN, or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, is issued by the IRS to help individuals fulfill their tax obligations legally and efficiently. If you’re wondering how to get one without mailing your passport or traveling for in-person appointments, Taxsym makes the <a href="#itin-number-application">ITIN number application</a> fast, simple, and completely online.

What Is an ITIN and Who Needs It?
An ITIN is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who are required to file a U.S. tax return but are not eligible for a Social Security Number. This applies to:

Foreign investors earning rental income from U.S. properties

Non-resident aliens filing U.S. tax returns  https://taxsym.com/itin

Dependents or spouses of U.S. residents

International students, researchers, or business professionals with U.S. tax reporting requirements

While the ITIN does not authorize work in the U.S. or provide Social Security benefits, it is essential for accurate and legal tax reporting.
